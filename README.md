        <h2>A BIT OF PERSONAL HISTORY</h2>
        <p>Growing up in Clinton, Iowa, I embraced a simple yet fulfilling childhood filled with sports, sunshine, and life lessons. Losing both parents to cancer during my late teens and early twenties was a challenging chapter, but it ultimately led me to find my amazing wife, Ashley, and step-kids, Leighton and Jace.</p>
        <p>In this journey, family has become my secure anchor, inspiring continuous growth and reflection. They have the wonderful ability to hold up a mirror and show me where I excel and where I have room for improvement. I’m forever grateful for their presence in my life.</p>
